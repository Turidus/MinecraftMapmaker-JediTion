#Lines that start with # are comments
#This file lists all base color ids, their RGB value and a list of blocks that represent that color on the minecraft map
#The structure is very rigid, especially empty lines could wreck havoc
#The top most block in this list is the default block
#Be aware: Transparent blocks only appear on the map if a solid block is placed under them.
#Add transparent blocks on your own peril.
